# GT-Mesh
## A Peer-To-Peer Mesh Implementation based on [rsms/gotalk](https://github.com/rsms/gotalk)

## Motivation & History
I found Rasmus's Gotalk to be very useful for RPC and with more experimentation founf the two server RPC capability to be great but wanted to expand to a bigger mesh or >2 Servers. I initially started out forking out the gotalk library but found that this 'Meshing' Capability was more complex than a simple patch. Further not sure of how it would impact the gotalk's core design and hence moved the code to gtmesh and here we go...
